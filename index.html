    <h1>GROVE STREET SUMMER IS UPON US</h1>

<p> <strong>Releasing</strong> on September 19th 2024, Grove Street Gangbangerz is the sophomore mixtape by the New Gen OG Phonk Artist DOC0. </p>
<p>On this new project he will try to: stray away from the concepts of his debut mixtape <strong>“LIVE RAW. SPEAK RAW. DIE HARD”</strong></p>
    <p>and will approach a different subgenre in OG Phonk Music also known as “Trill”. </p>
    <p>With this new music project <strong>DOC0</strong> will try to:
        <ul>
        <li><em>PROVE HIS VERSATILITY</em></li>
        </ul>
    </p>
        <p> and will go out of the <em><strong>RAW</strong></em> genre formula that is seen not only in his debut mixtape but in countless other mixtapes by NewGen and OldGen Phonk artists alike.</p>
       <p> He will also try to show that even when it comes to a different subgenre that has not been touched upon on his discography, he does not come off as a <em>one-trick pony</em>.</p>
    <p>With songs ranging from GANGSTA WALK to STRAIGHT FROM DA WEST to OUNCES, this mixtape will serve its purpose with its different shifts in energy, introduction of new genres and sounds never used by DOC0, all while still being enjoyable to listen to.</p>

        <p>Following his strong debut run and opinions of his contemporaries, expectations are high for this project.</p>
        
       <p> While he still has a lot of prove, DOC0 is confident in his approach when it comes to Phonk and music in general.<p>
        
        <p>This album will not show anything other than that. Dedication and passion towards the thing he loves to do. Creating music.<p>
